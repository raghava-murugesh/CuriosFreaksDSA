Solution:
class Solution:
    def find_height(self, tree, n, k):
        def wood_collected(H):
            return sum((height - H) for height in tree if height > H)

        low, high = 0, max(tree)

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            wood = wood_collected(mid)

            if wood == k:
                return mid  # Found the exact required height
            elif wood > k:
                low = mid + 1  # Try a taller cut to reduce wood
            else:
                high = mid - 1  # Too little wood, cut lower

        return -1
