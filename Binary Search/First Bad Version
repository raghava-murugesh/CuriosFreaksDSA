class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        low = 0

        ans = -1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high)//2
            if isBadVersion(mid):
                ans = mid
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        return ans
