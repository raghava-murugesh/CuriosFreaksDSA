Challenge Goal:
Write a function StringChallenge(str) that:
Takes in a string str formatted as "startTime-endTime", where both times are in 12-hour format with am/pm.
It should calculate and return the total number of minutes between the two times.
ğŸ•’ Example Given:
Input: "9:00am-10:00am"
This is 1 hour difference â†’ Output = 60
Input: "1:00pm-11:00am"
This crosses over midnight.
From 1:00pm to 11:00am the next day is 22 hours â†’ 22 Ã— 60 = 1320 minutes

Solution :
def StringChallenge(s):
    def time_to_minutes(t):
        time_part = t[:-2]
        am_pm = t[-2:]
        hours, minutes = map(int, time_part.split(':'))
        
        if hours == 12:
            hours = 0
        if am_pm == 'pm':
            hours += 12
        
        return hours * 60 + minutes

    start_time, end_time = s.split('-')
    start_min = time_to_minutes(start_time)
    end_min = time_to_minutes(end_time)

    if end_min >= start_min:
        return end_min - start_min
    else:
        return 1440 - start_min + end_min
